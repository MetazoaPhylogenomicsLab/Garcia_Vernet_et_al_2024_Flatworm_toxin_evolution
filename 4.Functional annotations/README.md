# README 5.Functional annotations

Here you can find different Folders that contain:

**1. FANTASIA annotations.** There are 2 different folders, one containing O.nungara results and another containing S.mediterranea results. Inside these folders you will also find the background used for the enrichment analyses, with the TopGO format and containing annotations for the proteins found in the proteomic analyses

**2. BLAST results.** The raw data have been directly copied from the web browser. Additionally, two tables are included: one for mucus and another for toxins. These tables contain the manually established groups used for the plots, along with tracking information detailing why proteins were assigned to each category and annotation.

**3. Top_Go_Enrichments:** Here you can find a mondel of the script used for TopGO enrichments, together with the outputs and the REVIGO outputs (R)

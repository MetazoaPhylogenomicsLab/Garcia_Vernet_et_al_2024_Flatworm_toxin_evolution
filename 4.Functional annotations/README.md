Inside these folders you will also find the background used for the enrichment analyses, with the TopGO format and containing annotations for the proteins found in the proteomic analyses

2. BLAST results. LAST results: The raw data has been directly copied from the web browser. Additionally, there are two tables included, one for mucus and another for Toxins. These tables contain the manually established groups used for the plots, and the tracking and comments for each protein.
